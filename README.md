# filler
The concept is simple: two players gain points by placing on a board, one after the other,
the game piece obtained by the game master (an executable Ruby program).
The game ends when the game piece cannot be placed anymore.

The goal of the project is to introduce to basic algorithm and handling of inputs/outputs.

Usage: ./filler_vm -f path[map] -p1 path[player1.filler] -p2 path[player2.filler]
