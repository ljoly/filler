# filler
The concept is simple: two players gain points by placing on a board, one after the other,
the game piece obtained by the game master (an executable Ruby program).
The game ends when both players cannot place a piece anymore.

The aim of the project is to introduce to basic algorithm and handling of inputs/outputs.

Usage: ./filler_vm -f path[map] -p1 path[player1.filler] -p2 path[player2.filler]

# graphic interface

Uses the 42 Minilibx.
To enable/disable the graphic interface : put 1/ 0 to GRAPH in filler.h (line 43).
